- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @karinaespinola
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in keep on growing personally and professionally. I love both backend and front-end development, however, I think I enjoy a little bit more backend development especially the analysis phase and work on a solution, that's my favorite part :) But I enjoy every opportunity I have to write some code :D\
Also, in the last couple of years, psychology has become one of my interests, I'm always in awe at the complexity of emotions we can all have and how important our mental health is! Also, lately I've been really into poetry, I had no idea how soothing it was!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and Next.js. Lately, I've been really into JavaScript and I'm always amazed by the new technologies related to it!

Thank you for reading this far you are awesome! Have a great day! ðŸ¥°
