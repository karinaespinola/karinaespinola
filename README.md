- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @karinaespinola
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in keep on growing personally and professionally. I love both backend and front-end development, however I think I enjoy a little bit more backend
development specially the analisys phase and work on a solution, that's definetly my favorite part :) But I enjoy every opportunity I have to write some code :D
Also, in the last couple of years Psychology has become one of my interests, I'm always at awe at the complexity of emotions we can all have and how important our mental health is!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and Next.js. Lately I've been really into JavaScript and I'm always amazed with the new technolgies related to it!

Thank you for reading this far you are awesome! Have a great day! ðŸ¥°
